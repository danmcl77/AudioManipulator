# AudioManipulator
This tool takes an input .WAV file which can then be run through a series of bizarro effects to produce *interesting* results.

The idea was conceived when I thought about how shuffle play is an industry standard feature for music playback but shuffle play applies only to a given play queue of songs. 
What if, in the age of lowering attention spans, individual songs could be themselves shuffled? Could I manipulate audio files so that they were cut into parts of equal length and then have these parts be shuffled randomly throughout the song?

So I made it because I thought it would be funny. Added a bunch of other fun effects too!
